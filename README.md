# PlusUltraGPT
Using ChatGPT to build an iOS app for physical therapy clients. 

The goal is to not write any code or design anything myself, and only prompt GPT4. I will use only the technical stack that GPT suggests, with minor tweaks to account for my OS. I will take any code at face value, and debug only by providing the error back to GPT for suggestions. My job will be simply to prompt GPT to write the correct code, and execute to the best of my abilities the recommendations made by GPT, with minor tweaks for my visual preferences (again, only by prompting GPT to adjust the code).

I've included the initial specs doc that GPT came up with after some initial prompting (App Specs.doc). I will periodically upload the conversation with GPT as the project progresses.
